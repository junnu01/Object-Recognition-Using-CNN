# Object-Recognition-Using-CNN
Object Recognition in Convolutional Neural Network using Deep Learning
In this mini project i have used the datasets of vairious images named CIFAR-10 Image datasets
Vaious Layers are used to detect the object from the images 
1. Convolutional Layer for Feature Extraction
2. Pooling Layer for Reducing Image Dimension
3. Activation Layer for introducing Non-Linearity in the model Eg. Sigmoid Activation Function, Tanh, Relu Activation Function
4. Fully-Connected Layer for 1 Dimension Image
5. Final layer will Display the images with their object Recognized
